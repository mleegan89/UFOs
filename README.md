# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to allow users the ability to search for UFO sightings using different filters. The filters include city, state, country and shape.

## Results
In order to perform this search the user can enter one or more filter and the appropriate results will display. For example, the image below represents a search of all UFO sightings record in the state of FL with a shape of 'other'.

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage would be that the user does not know exactly how to filter. EX: New York or NY, Virginia or VA? It may be more useful to continue this development to include prefill or button options when selecting a filter.
